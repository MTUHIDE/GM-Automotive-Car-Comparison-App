# GM-Automotive-Car-Comparison-App
<h2>About</h2>
Our project aims to provide an online interface for the general public to compare two General Motors vehicles side-by-side at a time to determine their best fit. Before deploying our website, we first gathered information on what prospective General Motors customers look for in a vehicle via a Google Forms survey. This survey helps our team prioritize attributes to keep track of GM vehicle features in our backend SQL database. We scraped data from General Motors’ website to obtain data in real-time and created a prototype of what our website could look like.

<h2>Technical Details</h2>

<h2>Instructions for Running Locally</h2>
Go to your preferred repository sharing software (Git, GitBash, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or GitHub Desktop)
Clone the GitHub repository into a folder on your local machine with these commands:
- cd [working_directory]
- git clone [repository_link]
Once you have the project on your local machine, open a terminal. Enter the commands cd car-comparison-vitejs and yarn run dev.
If this step does not work, enter the command yarn, which will provide a local host link. Copy the link and paste it into your preferred browser.
